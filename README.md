# Social_emotional_paper

Contains the R script used for (some) of the data analysis for the paper I am writing with Dr. Worrell on the association between social and emotional well-being and academic performance in high school students. The manuscript is currently in the submission process to a journal.

The original code for the data analysis was written in STATA; it turns out that UC Berkeley only has an online version of STATA that is very annoying to access, so I turned most of the code into R for ease of reference. That file is here for reference.

I collected the data in 2017-2018; since they contain information about individuals, I cannot make them public.
